# Blockchain E-voting System

A blockchain e-voting proof-of-concept (PoC) to ensure transparency and immutability.

Voters first need to register their identities on a smart contract. Once approved by an authority, voter will be able to vote for a candidate.

### Gas Station Network

To provide a better user experience for the voters, they do not need to pay for the gas fee when voting. The gas fee is subsidised by the smart contract owner.

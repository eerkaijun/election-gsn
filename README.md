# Blockchain E-voting System

A blockchain e-voting proof-of-concept (PoC) to ensure transparency and immutability.

### Gas Station Network

Using a relayer to relay transaction request, the end user does not have to pay for gas fee. The relayer will instead pay for the corresponding gas fee, and will receive the reimbursement from the smart contract owner.

### Getting Started
